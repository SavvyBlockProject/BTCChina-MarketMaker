## BTCChina Market Maker

This is a trading bot for the BTCChina.com bitcoin exchange. It continuously submits buy and sell orders at the current bid and ask prices in order to make money from the spread. I created the bot while BTCChina awarded a 0.1% trading rebate for market makers. Now that the trading rebate is no longer offered it is likely this is not profitable without further development. I don't recommend using this bot to trade your funds without going through the code yourself and adding additional safeguards. I'm not responsible for any financial loss that is incurred. 

To use this bot just put your public and private API keys into the variables at the bottom of `bot.py` and run the script. 

*Be warned that as soon as you run the program it will begin to enter trades of up to 10 BTC.*
